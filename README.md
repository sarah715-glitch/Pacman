# Overview

My goal was to create a pacman game in C++. This game allows the user to play on their computers. I wanted to create this so I could gain more experience using C++ and learn the difference between Python and this coding program.

# Development Environment

I used iostream, stdio.h, windows.h, string, and vector to build the pacman game.
